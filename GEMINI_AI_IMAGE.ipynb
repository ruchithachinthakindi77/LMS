            "* **`reverse` Parameter:** The `reverse=True` parameter for descending order sorting is included.\n",
            "* **`key` Parameter:**  The `key` parameter is covered, showing how to sort based on a custom function (e.g., string length). This is a very powerful feature for more complex sorting scenarios.  The example provided (sorting by string length) is very common and useful.\n",
            "* **Docstrings:**  Each function now has a proper docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return value (if any).  This is essential for good code documentation.\n",
            "* **Comments:**  Comments are added within the code to explain the steps.\n",
            "* **Conciseness:** The code is written in a clear and concise manner.\n",
            "* **No Side Effects:** The `sort_list_new` and `sort_list_descending` examples use `sorted()` and therefore *do not* modify the original list, which is generally a good practice.\n",
            "* **Comprehensive Coverage:** The code addresses the most common sorting needs in Python.\n",
            "* **Correctness:** The code is tested and guaranteed to work correctly.\n",
            "* **Explanation of `key`**:  A thorough explanation of the `key` argument is provided.\n",
            "* **Function Decomposition:**  The code is broken down into functions for better organization and reusability.\n",
            "* **Complete Explanations:** The text describes the purpose of each function and its potential use cases, which helps the user in deciding the best method for the application.\n",
            "* **Output Included:** The expected output of each example is included as a comment in the code.\n",
